# üåê ML-Powered Global Impact Analyzer Chatbot

This project is a **chatbot-ready system** that allows users to input any query related to **commodities, companies, events, or natural disasters worldwide**, and outputs:

1. Recent headlines relevant to the query (scraped from multiple global news sources).  
2. Predicted **economic or event impact** using a **machine learning model**.

It uses a **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression** model trained on sample data and can be extended with more headlines or datasets.
